Brain-Score Language is a platform to evaluate computational models of language on their match to behavioral and neural
measurements in the domain of language processing. The intent of Brain-Score is to adopt many (ideally all) the
experimental benchmarks in the field for the purpose of model testing, falsification, and comparison. To that end,
Brain-Score operationalizes experimental data into quantitative benchmarks that any model candidate following
the `BrainModel` interface can be scored on.

See the [Documentation](https://brain-score_language.readthedocs.io) for more details.

Brain-Score is made by and for the community. To contribute,
