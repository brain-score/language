### How-to work with `HuggingfaceSubject`:
`HuggingfaceSubject` is a sub-class of the abstract class `ArtificialSubject` and allows experimenters to replicate human natural language experiments on models from the Hugging Face library of models.

First, the model is set-up as a `HuggingfaceSubject` instance. 

Next, the model is instructed what kind of behavioral or neural recording task needs to be done using 

New `task` and `recording_type` should be defined both in the `ArtificialSubject` class' `Task` class inside `artificial_subject.py`, and inside `self.task_function_mapping_dict` in `HuggingfaceSubject`'s `__init__` to be accessed during inference.  

Lastly, the task is performed using

to get outputs of the task, or using 

to get the reprensetation behind the task. 

For more examples of usage of these models, refer to the unit tests in `tests/test_models/test_huggingface.py`.
